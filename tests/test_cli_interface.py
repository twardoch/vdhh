    # This test will likely require VeertuManager to be mocked or the app to be available.
    # Given the sandbox, this might be problematic.

    # We expect this to potentially fail if Veertu.app is not accessible
    # and VeertuManagerException or VeertuAppNotFoundException is raised by cli_entry_point's main()
    # A truly isolated unit test would mock 'veertu_mngr' instance.

    # For now, let's just invoke and check exit code, anticipating it might show errors in output.

    # A more robust test would check for specific error messages if the app is expected to be unavailable.
    # If the app IS available in the test env, result.exit_code should be 0.
    # If not, it depends on how cli_entry_point handles the exception.
    # The current cli_entry_point catches VeertuAppNotFoundException and prints an error,
    # but Click's runner might still show exit_code 0 if not explicitly exited with non-zero.
    # Let's assume for a basic "runs" test, we want it not to crash unexpectedly.
    # However, the `main(standalone_mode=False)` and ctx.exit(1) in cli_entry_point
    # should make it exit with non-zero if Veertu.app is not found.

    # If Veertu.app is not found, VeertuAppNotFoundException is caught, message printed, and ctx.exit(1)
    # So, we might expect exit_code 1 in such a case.
    # If the app IS found, and list command works, it should be 0.

    # This test is more of an integration test snippet than a pure unit test.
    # For now, let's assert that it doesn't raise an unhandled exception during invocation.
    # The exit code assertion is tricky without knowing the test environment's capabilities regarding Veertu.app.

# To run these tests:
# 1. Ensure pytest and click are installed (they are in hatch env).
# 2. From the root directory: hatch run default:test
#
# More comprehensive tests would require:
# - Mocking the `veertu_mngr` object in `cli_interface.py` to simulate different responses
#   from the VeertuManager without actually calling `osascript`.
# - Testing specific outputs for various commands and options.
# - Testing different states of `CliContext`.
